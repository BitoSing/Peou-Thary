								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic0.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p></p>
								<p>I can't really explain how much I love you and I feel for you, but the moment I see you, I feel silence, I feel lucky, I feel love and comfortable. When I first saw you in POE class, I really really wanted to talk to you, and making out with you. But sadly at that time, I don't have this confident to show and tell you how much I love you. I remembered the moment that I tell you about I see something inside you which make me love you? Yes, it's your heart, your soul, your presence, it made me feel warmth. Yes, it seems like very fast for both of us. But I don't think, it fast enough to let us falling inlove. Love is a word, it is very to say. But what is LOVE really define? For me, I think love is when 2 people making out together, build the memories together, create something which can never forget, make each other feel love. I may made a mistake which making you a rush to love me. lemme be honest with you. I've been broken since 4 years ago. It was so hard to fight with anxiety. Until I made it. And since I saw you, suddenly, I feel love once again. Before I decide to say that I love you, I also thought that I cannot be a good partner, because I don't have a job, don't have anything yet, still rely on family. But you, you already earn money. I feel like I'm low and not suitable for you. I may still not mature enough to control my feeling, but I know exactly what the love is. And I'm tired of it. But with your presence, your smile, your face, and You. It keeps me waiting and believe there is still hope for trusting and love again. But now it seems like, i'm the only one who think about it too much. Maybe this is the one side feel and one side love. I know that you're afraid of hurting me by pretending that You can make out with me when you're not ready. But I don't blame you. I'm sorry that I can't be a men who you can rely on. I'm such an asshole. The day that I decide to walk away from you, it's not about you. It's about me, Look at me, what do I have? I have nothing for you. I'm not handsome, I'm not slim, I can't go out at night, I can't even control my feeling. But you, You're beautiful, Generous, smell good, good enough for me. And since the day that I said I'm done from chasing you, it is not what I really meant. I just don't the how to stay with ignorance, feel like doesn't exist in your world. Yeah you may really busy with your work, but I don't think, you cannot take 15second to care about me. I feel like i'm the one who really wanted this love but not you. When I said i'm serious with this love, I really am. But since you don't love me, I dun need to talk about something else too much. Anyway, Happy MERRY CHRISTMAS MY DEAR LOVE PEOU THARY. I wish the best of you. With this message, I hope you understand my love for you, it is not some of joke. <span class="Danger"> So, if you still want to making out with me once more time, just call me. But if your answer is no. Don't call me. </span>  And I hope that you will find someone who is good enough for you and love you for who you're. And this is my last message from me if your answer is no, I won't bother you anymore.
									<!-- People cannot be perfect, nobody is perfect. I love you because you give me back my soul of love, feel of joy being around people I love. It seems very fast for both of us, but I think I make the right choice of choosing you as My love, My girlfriend. I don't regret for what I've had decide. Even though we can be each other or not. I'm happy for having you around me. I know you've been through a lot of pain, tired, stress, don't wanna think about love. But don't give up on us okay? I promise, I'll be the one for you. You're beautiful enough for yourself. And I'm happy for you. I love you <span class="icon fa-heart"></span>, but it doesn't mean you need to feel loved from me and try to force yourself to love me. All I want in Christmas is you my dear love PEOU THARY. You're a mature beautiful women who I love most after family.  -->
									<br> 
									<br>
									I wish the best of you my love Thary. Enjoy your Christmas Day and Happy New Year.
									<!-- From now on, I promise I will love you for as much as I can. I don't treat you as a friend, as a girlfriend, but I'll tread you as my future wife even I still dun have anything right now. But i'm promise, I'll try my best for this love. I'll accept everything from you, I'm willing to do anything for this love. But can you promise me one thing? You don't use this feeling and this love for advantages or as entertainment. All I want from Christmas and my life from now on is You PEOU THARY.
									<br>
									<br>
									I love you my dear love. I want to spend my time with you, talk things with you, create memories together. I love you Purple Girl <span class="icon fa-heart"></span>.
									<br>
									<br>
									Eventhough, now we're stranger again. I still love you for who you're, maybe it's the best for letting you go. Maybe i'm not good enough for this love. But I wish the best of you. I hope you'll meet another person who can give you warm enough, a person who you like to spend time with, a person who can do anyting for you, a person who better than me. I don't hate you. I just love you so much that I forget to love myself again. All the words and sentences that I said it is true. It's not your fault that afraid of hurting me. But it is me, it's my fault for letting you hurt me. I took 2 chances already to believing you, that you can love me back but I failed by the way. Thank you so much for make me feel loved again. Lastly, I wish the best of you. THANK YO THARY. 
									<br>
									<br>
									Lastly, I wanna say something a bit more, just wanna be clear, I don't hate you, I choose to walk away because I think maybe i'm the one who not ready to be loved. I know you afraid of hurting, but i'm the one who afraid of hurting you, I know You've been through alot of pain and mistakes, don't blame yourself okay? I still love you, love you for who you are, but I think I don't deserve you. I can't really control myself about my temp. But you deserve a man who has responsible more than me. A man who can make you found yourself, a man who could tell stories and funny thing to you. I mean You're already the best for me. It is very hard to trust someone. And I've been through alot of pain too. Just know that, I'm in love with you. I really love you, and love you since I saw you. If you miss me just call me. The reason I chose to walk away, because I can't stand and don't know how to deal with ignorance. I don't like being ignore or feel like I didn't exist in your world. Or maybe I'm too needy. But I think this is a way for your good. If we have fate with each other, we will be with each other. And if we don't, just let it be. All I want is seeing you happy. Living in a peaceful life. Enjoy your every moment. And Lastly Hope you get what you want. I love You Peou Thary. -->
